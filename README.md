 The Contact Manager App is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that allows users to manage a list of contacts. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the contacts. This project aims to demonstrate a basic but functional application that uses a MongoDB database for data storage, an Express backend for API handling, and a React frontend for the user interface.
